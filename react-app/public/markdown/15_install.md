#### Install & dev

> To connect to Bitquery requires an API key, which can't be exposed in a public repo and is therefore abstracted to an `.env`. Just un-zip `/react-app/env.zip` for a cheaty workaround 

```shell
cd <working-dir>
git clone https://github.com/listingslab/bitcoin-hash
cd bitcoin-hash
unzip react-app/env.zip
npm install
npm test
# new tab
npm start
```
