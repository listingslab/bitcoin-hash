#### Portability

Whatever code comes next should be be modular enough to pick up and place in any JavaScript App. That's done by creating a folder called `/src/BitcoinHash` in which all bitcoin-hash code lives. This command will install those deps in your-project. It won't matter if you already have them

```shell
npm install @apollo/client graphql react-redux @reduxjs/toolkit redux-persist @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled @mui/icons-material moment
```

#### Create React App

The goal is that so long as the required dependencies exist in the main project, the Bitcoin Hash model/app/whatever should work anywhere. Like Storybook

`npx create-react-app react-app --template redux-typescript`
